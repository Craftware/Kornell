This project is a new e-learning platform to change the way we educate ourselves. Current e-learning solutions and content, especially in developing countries, leave much to be desired in technology and services.
 
Learning is proven to be more effective when done socially and interactivelly, not by watching silly animations or playing games that are not challenging. This platform will enable developers to publish interactive, social, and exciting content.

Technology is an essential piece of education, and this project supports high quality web technologies with high fidelity audio, HD video, and mobile and desktop presentations.

The aim is to be extremely cost efficient, leveraging the scaling advantages of cloud computing and offering this platform through an open source project. By allowing institutions of any size, budget, and maturity to use this technology, education can be made more easily accessible for everyone.

If you would like to be contribute, plase message the project team. There is a lot more work to do!
